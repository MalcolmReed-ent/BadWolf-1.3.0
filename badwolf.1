.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/badwolf/content-filters.json
WebKit-specific content-filter file, this allows to block unwanted content (ads, nagware, ...).
For some introductory information about the format see:
.Lk https://webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/
.Lk https://webkit.org/blog/4062/targeting-domains-with-content-blockers/
.Lk https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/creating_a_content_blocker
.Pp
For a converter using AblockPlus-style filters, try:
.Lk https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abp2blocklist
.Pp
For a ready-to-use file (that you should update periodically), try:
.Lk https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist_min_content_blocker.json
.It Pa ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/badwolf/filters
This is where the compiled filters are stored, the file(s) in it are automatically generated and so shouldn't be edited.
Documented here only for sandboxing / access-control purposes.
.It Pa ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/badwolf/bookmarks.xbel
XBEL (XML Bookmark Exchange Language) file, known to be currently supported by:
.Xr elinks 1 ,
.Xr konqueror 1 ,
.Xr kbookmarkeditor 1 .
.Pp
You can do a symbolic link from their path, but you might prefer to use
.Lk https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/ XInclude
which is natively supported by
.Nm
to automatically merge multiple XBEL files.
.Pp
Also the bookmark entries aren't re-sorted, so you might want to put your most frequently used ones at the top of the file.
.Pp
For more information about this format see:
.Lk http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/
.Pp
For an example XBEL file see:
.Lk https://hacktivis.me/bookmarks.xbel
.It Pa ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/badwolf/webkit-web-extension/
Directory containing the
.Lk https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebExtension.html WebKitWebExtensions
to be loaded into
.Nm . Note: They aren't the JavaScript-based Web-Extensions supported by Firefox or Chrome, but native code in shared objects using the WebKitGTK API.
.Pp
Examples of useful extensions may be found at:
.Lk https://hacktivis.me/git/badwolf-extensions
.It Pa ${DATADIR:-/usr/local/share}/badwolf/interface.css
.It Pa ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/badwolf/interface.css
CSS files (respectively system and user-level) for styling
.Nm
interface.
See
.Lk https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/css-properties.html
for the properties being available.
.Pp
For testing your styles I would recommend using the
.Ev GTK_DEBUG=interactive
environment variable on launching
.Nm
and going to the CSS tab.
.It Pa ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/badwolf/scripts/
Directory containing JS userscripts (ending in
.Ic .js )
ran at the start of page loads,
nesting down into iframes, useful to override website behaviors or add
missing features to websites.
.Pp
Please note that for now unlike GreaseMonkey-style userscripts, they are
always run, regardless of the hostname / URLs.
